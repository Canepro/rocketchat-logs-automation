- `Analyze-RocketChatDump.ps1` - Pass additional data to report generator

**Deliverables:**
- Detailed log entry extraction with metadata
- Complete settings categorization and parsing
- Enhanced app information with status details

### Phase 2: Interactive HTML Components
**Files to Modify:**
- `modules/ReportGenerator.psm1` - Complete rewrite of HTML generation

**New Features:**
- Collapsible/expandable sections
- Interactive log entry drill-down
- Searchable/filterable content
- Responsive JavaScript components

### Phase 3: Enhanced User Interface
**Deliverables:**
- Professional JavaScript-enhanced interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization for large datasets

## üìä Technical Implementation Plan

### Issue #15: App Names Display (Easiest - Start Here)
```powershell
# Enhanced app parsing in RocketChatLogParser.psm1
function Get-DetailedAppInfo {
    # Extract: name, version, status, type, enabled state
    # Categorize: enabled, disabled, errored, outdated
    # Return structured data for HTML rendering
}
```

### Issue #14: Expandable Settings
```powershell
# Enhanced settings categorization
function Get-CategorizedSettings {
    # Categories: General, Accounts, FileUpload, Email, Security, Omnichannel
    # Structure for collapsible display
    # Include setting descriptions and recommendations
}
```

### Issue #13: Interactive Logs (Most Complex)
```powershell
# Enhanced log processing with context
function Get-InteractiveLogData {
    # Top 50-100 critical entries
    # Full message content with metadata
    # Context from surrounding entries
    # JavaScript data structure for client-side rendering
}
```

## üé® HTML/JavaScript Architecture

- [ ] Mobile-responsive interface

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1. **Implement Issue #15** (Apps) - Quickest win
2. **Implement Issue #14** (Settings) - Medium complexity
3. **Implement Issue #13** (Logs) - Most complex
4. **Integration Testing** - All features working together
5. **Performance Testing** - Large dataset handling
6. **UI/UX Polish** - Professional appearance
7. **Documentation Update** - User guides and examples

## üìù Testing Strategy

- Test with real RocketChat 7.8.0 dump data
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Performance testing with large log files
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## üì¶ Version Planning

**Target Version**: 1.4.0
**Branch**: `feature/interactive-html-reports-v1.4.0`
**Estimated Timeline**: Phased implementation with testing at each stage
