## When to Use Which Version

### PowerShell Version - Best For:
- **Windows Environments**: Native integration with Windows systems
- **Advanced Analytics**: More sophisticated pattern analysis and trending
- **PowerShell Workflows**: Integration with existing PowerShell automation
- **Enterprise Windows**: Better integration with Windows-centric tools
- **Detailed Reporting**: More advanced HTML report generation
- **Object-Based Processing**: PowerShell's object pipeline advantages

### Bash Version - Best For:
- **Linux/Unix Environments**: Native on most Linux distributions
- **Container Deployments**: Lightweight, minimal dependencies
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Better integration with most DevOps tools
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across Linux, macOS, WSL
- **Shell Scripting**: Easy integration with existing bash automation
- **Performance**: Generally faster for large file processing

## Performance Characteristics

| Aspect | PowerShell | Bash |
|--------|------------|------|
| Startup Time | ~2-3 seconds | ~0.5 seconds |
| Memory Usage | ~50-100MB | ~10-20MB |
| JSON Processing | Native .NET | External `jq` dependency |
| File Processing | Object-based | Stream-based (faster) |
| Error Handling | Comprehensive | Traditional shell |
| Regex Support | .NET regex | POSIX regex + grep |

## Dependencies

### PowerShell Version
- PowerShell 5.1+ (built into Windows 10+)
- .NET Framework/.NET Core (included)
- No external dependencies

### Bash Version
- Bash 4.0+ (available on most systems)
- `jq` (JSON processor) - needs installation
- Standard Unix tools (grep, awk, sed, wc, sort)

## Installation Complexity

### PowerShell
```powershell
# Windows - Already installed
# macOS/Linux
brew install powershell  # or package manager
```

### Bash
```bash
# Most systems - Already installed
# Dependencies
sudo apt install jq      # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install jq          # macOS
yum install jq           # CentOS/RHEL
```

## Example Output Comparison

Both versions produce functionally identical output:

### Console Output
- Same color coding and formatting
- Identical health scores and metrics
- Same issue categorization

### JSON Output
- Identical structure and data
- Same metadata and analysis results
- Cross-compatible between versions

### HTML Reports
- Similar styling and layout
- Same data visualization
- Minor differences in generation metadata

## Migration Between Versions

Data and configuration files are fully compatible:
- `config/analysis-rules.json` works with both versions
- JSON exports can be processed by either version
- Report formats are consistent

## Recommendation

**For most users**: Start with the version native to your environment
- Windows shops: PowerShell version
- Linux/macOS shops: Bash version
- Mixed environments: Both (they're compatible)

**For specific use cases**:
- **CI/CD**: Bash version (lighter, faster)
- **Windows automation**: PowerShell version (better integration)
- **Advanced analytics**: PowerShell version (more features)
- **Simple monitoring**: Bash version (minimal overhead)
