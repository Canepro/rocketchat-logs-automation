# Visual Verification Checklist for Fixed PowerShell HTML Reports

## ✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE (FIXED VERSION):

### 1. Clean Professional Layout
- Single, well-formatted HTML document
- RocketChat branding and styling
- Responsive design with good visual hierarchy

### 2. Exactly 6 Main Sections (All at Same Level):
```
📊 Health Overview ▼
📝 Interactive Log Analysis ▼  
⚙️ Configuration Analysis ▼
⚙️ Configuration Settings ▼
💡 Recommendations & Action Items ▼
📋 Analysis Summary & Technical Details ▶
```

### 3. Proper Section Structure:
- All sections are TOP-LEVEL (not nested inside each other)
- Each section is collapsible/expandable
- Recommendations and Analysis Summary are INDEPENDENT sections

### 4. No Duplication Issues:
- No duplicate headers
- No repeated content
- No multiple HTML document starts
- Clean, single document structure

## ❌ WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT SEE (OLD BROKEN VERSION):

### Critical Issues That Were Fixed:
- ✗ Duplicate "RocketChat Support Dump Analysis Report" headers
- ✗ Recommendations section appearing INSIDE Configuration Settings
- ✗ Multiple DOCTYPE declarations
- ✗ Broken layout with nested sections
- ✗ File size bloated to 50+KB from duplication

## 🧪 Technical Verification:
- File size should be ~46KB (not 50+KB)
- Only 1 HTML document structure
- All sections properly closed and independent

## 🔍 How to Test:
1. Scroll through the entire report
2. Verify section hierarchy is flat (not nested)
3. Check that Recommendations appears AFTER Configuration Settings ends
4. Ensure no content appears duplicated
5. Test section expand/collapse functionality

If you see the "FIXED VERSION" characteristics, the PowerShell HTML generation is now working correctly and matches the bash version quality!
