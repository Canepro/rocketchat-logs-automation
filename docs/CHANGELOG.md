- **Production Ready**: 100% completion status achieved

## [1.5.0] - 2025-07-21

### Added ‚ú®
- **Professional Repository Structure**: Complete reorganization for GitHub professionalism
- **Easy Entry Points**: Simple `analyze.ps1/.sh/.bat` and `test.ps1/.sh/.bat` wrappers in root
- **Organized Directory Structure**: 
  - `scripts/` for main analyzers
  - `tests/` for all testing tools
  - `docs/` for documentation
  - `examples/` for samples and demonstrations
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added ARCHITECTURE.md with technical design details
- **Clean README**: Modern formatting with badges, clear structure, and complete project overview
- **Sample Reports Directory**: Organized HTML output examples for easy reference

### Improved üöÄ
- **Repository Appearance**: Transformed from cluttered root to professional open-source layout
- **File Organization**: All scripts moved to appropriate directories with updated path references
- **Documentation Structure**: Complete docs reorganization with clear navigation
- **User Experience**: Simple commands at root level while maintaining organized backend
- **Testing Framework**: All test scripts properly organized and accessible

- **Entry Point Parameters**: Fixed parameter passing in wrapper scripts
- **Cross-Platform Paths**: Updated all internal script references for new directory structure
- **Help Functionality**: Proper help display through Get-Help in wrapper scripts

### Migration Notes üì¶
- All main functionality now accessed through root-level entry points
- Previous direct script calls should use new wrapper scripts
- All test tools moved to `tests/` directory but accessible via `test.ps1/.sh/.bat`
- Documentation moved to `docs/` directory with comprehensive architecture guide

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-21

### Added ‚ú®
- **Complete Feature Parity**: Bash and PowerShell versions now have 100% identical functionality
- **Enhanced Configuration Settings Analysis**: Expandable categories (SAML, LDAP, API, Accounts, Email, FileUpload, Security, Performance)
- **Large-Scale Support**: Successfully tested with 1000+ settings from real RocketChat production dumps
- **HTML Content Escaping**: Safe handling of XML templates and complex configurations (SAML AuthRequest templates)
- **Interactive HTML Reports**: Collapsible sections with proper visual separation
- **Real-World Testing**: Validated with actual RocketChat 7.8.0 support dumps (173KB settings files)

### Improved üöÄ
- **Settings File Mapping**: Prioritizes main settings over omnichannel for consistent analysis
- **JSON Parsing**: Enhanced array handling with proper delimiter-based parsing for multi-line content
- **HTML Structure**: Proper section boundaries prevent content merging under SAML settings
- **Cross-Platform Paths**: Better WSL and native path handling for Windows users
- **Performance**: Efficient processing of large configuration datasets

### Fixed üêõ
- HTML structure issues causing sections to appear merged under SAML Settings
- Multi-line XML content breaking HTML rendering when not properly escaped
- Settings categories not displaying with pipe-delimited parsing vs equals-delimited
- Configuration Settings count discrepancies between console and HTML output
- SAML template XML fragments appearing as malformed separate settings

### Security üîí
- HTML injection prevention through comprehensive content escaping
- Safe XML/HTML content rendering in configuration templates
- Input validation for complex multi-line configuration values

### Technical Details üîß
- Updated jq patterns from `to_entries[]` to `.[]` for JSON array processing
- Changed delimiter parsing from `=` to `|` for improved multi-line content handling
- Added sed-based HTML escaping for setting names and values
- Enhanced section boundaries with `<section class="main-section">` tags
- Improved error handling for large configuration datasets

**üéØ Production Ready**: Successfully processes real RocketChat dumps with 1021+ settings, 262 security settings, and 64 performance settings.
