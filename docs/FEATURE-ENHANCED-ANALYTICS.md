- **Temporal Analysis**
  - Time-series analysis of message volumes
  - Peak usage pattern identification
  - Seasonal trend detection

- **Correlation Analysis** 
  - Cross-reference errors with system events
  - Identify causal relationships between issues
  - Predict cascading failure patterns

### 2. Enhanced Security Analytics
- **Advanced Threat Detection**
  - Suspicious login pattern analysis
  - Brute force attack identification
  - Unusual file upload behavior detection
  
- **Compliance Monitoring**
  - GDPR compliance checking
  - HIPAA compliance validation
  - SOC 2 requirement verification

### 3. Performance Intelligence
