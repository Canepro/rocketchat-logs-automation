## When to Use Which Version

### PowerShell Version - RECOMMENDED üèÜ
- **Primary Choice**: Most accurate and comprehensive analysis
- **Composite Dump Files**: Only version that correctly parses complex dump structures
- **Security Analysis**: Superior detection of configuration issues
- **Windows Environments**: Native integration with Windows systems
- **Enterprise Analysis**: Comprehensive reporting for critical systems
- **Advanced Analytics**: Sophisticated pattern analysis and trending
- **Detailed Reporting**: More advanced HTML report generation

### Bash Version - LIGHTWEIGHT ALTERNATIVE ‚ö°
- **Simple Dump Files**: Works well for individual dump file analysis
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Minimal dependencies, fast execution
- **Container Deployments**: Lightweight, smaller footprint
- **Quick Assessments**: Fast health checks and basic analysis
- **Linux/Unix Environments**: Native on most distributions
- **Known Limitations**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot properly parse composite dump files

## Current Known Issues (v1.4.6)

### Bash Version Limitations
- **Critical**: Fails to parse composite dump files like `standard-dump.json`
- **Impact**: Shows 100% health score when issues exist
- **Workaround**: Use individual dump files (e.g., `7.8.0-settings.json`) or PowerShell version
- **Status**: Under investigation for future versions

### PowerShell Version Status
- **‚úÖ All Issues Fixed**: Security issue duplication resolved in v1.4.6
- **‚úÖ Fully Functional**: Correctly processes all dump file types
- **‚úÖ Production Ready**: Recommended for all critical analysis work

## Performance Characteristics

| Aspect | PowerShell | Bash |
|--------|------------|------|
| Startup Time | ~2-3 seconds | ~0.5 seconds |
| Memory Usage | ~50-100MB | ~10-20MB |
| JSON Processing | Native .NET | External `jq` dependency |
| File Processing | Object-based | Stream-based (faster) |
| Error Handling | Comprehensive | Traditional shell |
| Regex Support | .NET regex | POSIX regex + grep |

## Dependencies

### PowerShell Version
- PowerShell 5.1+ (built into Windows 10+)
- .NET Framework/.NET Core (included)
- No external dependencies

### Bash Version
- Bash 4.0+ (available on most systems)
- `jq` (JSON processor) - needs installation
- Standard Unix tools (grep, awk, sed, wc, sort)

## Installation Complexity

### PowerShell
```powershell
# Windows - Already installed
# macOS/Linux
brew install powershell  # or package manager
```

### Bash
```bash
# Most systems - Already installed
# Dependencies
sudo apt install jq      # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install jq          # macOS
yum install jq           # CentOS/RHEL
```

## Example Output Comparison

Both versions produce functionally identical output:

### Console Output
- Same color coding and formatting
- Identical health scores and metrics
- Same issue categorization

### JSON Output
- Identical structure and data
- Same metadata and analysis results
- Cross-compatible between versions

### HTML Reports
- Similar styling and layout
- Same data visualization
- Minor differences in generation metadata

## Migration Between Versions

Data and configuration files are fully compatible:
- `config/analysis-rules.json` works with both versions
- JSON exports can be processed by either version
- Report formats are consistent

## Recommendation

**For most users**: Start with the version native to your environment
- Windows shops: PowerShell version
- Linux/macOS shops: Bash version
- Mixed environments: Both (they're compatible)

**For specific use cases**:
- **CI/CD**: Bash version (lighter, faster)
- **Windows automation**: PowerShell version (better integration)
- **Advanced analytics**: PowerShell version (more features)
- **Simple monitoring**: Bash version (minimal overhead)
