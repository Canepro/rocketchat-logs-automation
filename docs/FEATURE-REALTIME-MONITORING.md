# ðŸ”„ Real-time Monitoring & Live Log Analysis

## Overview
Transform the static analysis tool into a dynamic monitoring solution capable of real-time log analysis and continuous system monitoring.

## Current State
- Post-mortem analysis of static dump files
- Manual execution required
- No continuous monitoring capabilities

## Proposed Features

### 1. Live Log Streaming
- **Real-time Log Ingestion**
  - Direct connection to RocketChat log endpoints
  - WebSocket-based live log streaming
  - Configurable sampling rates and filters

- **Hot-path Analysis**
  - Immediate pattern matching on incoming logs
  - Real-time alerting for critical issues
  - Sliding window analytics

### 2. Continuous Monitoring Dashboard
- **Live Metrics Display**
  - Real-time user activity monitoring
  - Message flow visualization
  - System health indicators

- **Interactive Alerts**
  - Configurable threshold-based alerts
  - Email/Slack/Teams notifications
  - Escalation procedures

### 3. Historical Trending
- **Time-series Data Storage**
  - Long-term metric retention
  - Trend analysis capabilities
  - Comparative historical analysis

- **Predictive Alerts**
  - Early warning system based on trends
  - Capacity planning alerts
  - Performance degradation predictions

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
RocketChat Server â†’ Log Stream â†’ Analysis Engine â†’ Alert System
                                      â†“
                              Real-time Dashboard
                                      â†“
                              Historical Database
```

### Components
- **Log Stream Connector**: WebSocket/HTTP streaming client
- **Real-time Processor**: High-performance event processing
- **Alert Engine**: Configurable notification system
- **Dashboard Server**: Web-based monitoring interface
- **Data Store**: Time-series database for historical data

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: PowerShell Core 7+ / .NET 6+
- **Frontend**: HTML5/JavaScript dashboard
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL for historical data
- **Streaming**: SignalR for real-time updates

## Configuration Example
```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "enabled": true,
    "endpoints": {
      "rocketchat": "wss://your-rocket.chat/websocket"
    },
    "alerts": {
      "errorThreshold": 10,
      "responseTimeThreshold": 2000,
      "notifications": ["email", "slack"]
    },
    "retention": {
      "metrics": "30d",
      "logs": "7d"
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits
- **Immediate Issue Detection**: Catch problems as they happen
- **Reduced MTTR**: Faster incident response times
- **Operational Visibility**: Complete system observability
- **Proactive Management**: Prevent issues before they impact users

## Implementation Priority
**Medium** - Valuable for production environments but requires significant architectural changes.

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1 (Live Streaming): 3-4 weeks
- Phase 2 (Dashboard): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3 (Alerting): 2 weeks
- Phase 4 (Historical Analysis): 2 weeks

## Success Metrics
- 95% uptime through proactive monitoring
- Sub-minute detection of critical issues
- 75% reduction in incident response time
