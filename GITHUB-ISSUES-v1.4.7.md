## Issue #1: [BUG] Bash Script Fails with "unbound variable: security_issues" Error

**Labels**: `bug`, `bash`, `critical`, `fixed`

### **Description**
The Bash script crashes with an "unbound variable: security_issues" error when analyzing RocketChat dumps that are missing log files or when certain analysis functions don't execute.

### **Steps to Reproduce**
1. Run the Bash analyzer on a dump directory missing log files
2. Execute: `bash analyze-rocketchat-dump.sh --format html /path/to/partial-dump/`
3. Script fails with error: `line 1557: security_issues: unbound variable`

### **Expected Behavior**
Script should handle missing components gracefully and generate reports without errors.

### **Actual Behavior**
Script crashes and terminates with unbound variable error.

### **Environment**
- OS: Windows 11 with WSL
- Bash version: WSL Bash
- RocketChat Analyzer version: v1.4.6

### **Root Cause**
Variables like `security_issues`, `performance_issues`, and `configuration_warnings` were not initialized when certain analysis functions didn't execute due to missing dump components.

### **Solution Implemented**
- Added proper initialization for all `ANALYSIS_RESULTS` array variables with default values of 0
- Enhanced function-level variable initialization in `generate_html_report()`
- Improved error handling for partial dumps

### **Fixed In**
- Version: v1.4.7
- Commit: [Link to commit]
- PR: #[PR_NUMBER]

## Issue #2: [BUG] Bash HTML Report Generation Function Incomplete/Broken

**Labels**: `bug`, `bash`, `html-reports`, `regression`, `fixed`

### **Description**
The `generate_html_report()` function in the Bash script was regressed to an incomplete state, missing critical report sections and producing malformed HTML output.

### **Steps to Reproduce**
1. Run the Bash analyzer with HTML output format
2. Execute: `bash analyze-rocketchat-dump.sh --format html /path/to/dump/`
3. HTML output is incomplete and missing sections

### **Expected Behavior**
HTML report should include all sections:
- Health Overview
- Detailed Recommendations
- Analysis Details
- Configuration Settings
- Technical Summary

### **Actual Behavior**
HTML report was incomplete with broken/missing sections and poor formatting.

### **Environment**
- OS: Windows 11 with WSL
- Bash version: WSL Bash
- RocketChat Analyzer version: v1.4.6

### **Root Cause**
The `generate_html_report()` function had regressed to an old, incomplete version missing most report sections and proper styling.

### **Solution Implemented**
- Complete replacement of the HTML generation function
- Restored all missing report sections
- Added professional CSS styling
- Ensured cross-platform parity with PowerShell version

### **Fixed In**
- Version: v1.4.7
- Commit: [Link to commit]
- PR: #[PR_NUMBER]
